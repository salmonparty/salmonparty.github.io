    <h1 class="lobster" style="font-family: 'Lobster',cursive, sans-serif; ">Welcome to the salmon party website.</h1>
<p>We have 3 main beliefs:</p>
</div>
<br/>
<button class="collapsible">Free healthcare</button>
<div class="content" style="font-size:14px;">
  <p>If I am elected, I would attempt to establish Free Universal healthcare. It is important to keep healthcare as available as possible, to help people who may not have the money to pay for it to stay healthy, and to keep it affordable for people who can afford it. According to the World Health Organization, about 100 million people are currently being kept in poverty by the costs of healthcare, while over 800 million spent at least 10% of their money to pay for healthcare.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<button class="collapsible">Affordable post-secondary education</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I would also put more affordable post-secondary education in place. I believe it is important to keep post-secondary education as affordable as possible because student loans make it difficult financially for recent graduates of college, and especially when the loans linger. Making post-secondary education would make it easier for graduates to get a start working and paying living costs. According to data compiled by Forbes and CNBC, the debt total(data taken from over 44 million americans) is $1.52 trillion as of 2018, an increase from previous years. Though this is also potentially related to the increase in graduates from college, it still shows an increase in the cost of loans.</p>
